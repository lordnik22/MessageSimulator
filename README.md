# MessageSimulator
We try to learn hybride, message-orientierte and reactive and the effects of it 


## Running the application locally

Open sample01 with eclipse or intellij. See pom.xml for java
requirements. Make a maven reload.


Steps
1. docker-compose up
2. Start sample-application within intellij

- zookeeper = coordination service for distributed applications
- KRaft =  Apache Kafka Raft (KRaft) is the consensus protocol that was introduced in KIP-500 to remove Apache Kafkaâ€™s dependency on ZooKeeper for metadata management.

Java Message Service (JMS) vs Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)

## Compare Message Broker

Apache ActiveMQ is a great workhorse full of features and nice stuff.
It's not the fastest MQ software around but fast enough for most use
cases. Among features are flexible clustring, fail-over, integrations
with different application servers, security etc.

Apache Apollo is an attempt to write a new core for ActiveMQ to cope
with a large amount of clients and messages. It does not have all nice
and convenient feature of ActiveMQ but scales a lot better. Apache
Apollo is a really fast MQ implementation when you give it a large
multi-core server and thousands of concurrent connections. It has a
nice, simple UI, but is not a "one-size-fits-all" solution.

It seems that there is an attempt ongoing to merge a number of
ActiveMQ features with HornetQ under the name ActiveMQ Artemis.
HornetQ has JMS2.0 support, so my humble guess is that it's likely to
appear in ActiveMQ 6.x.

Kafka is a different beast. It's a very simple message broker intended
to scale persistent publish subscribe (topics) as fast as possible
over multiple servers. For small-medium sized deployments, Kafka is
probably not the best option. It also has it's way to do things to
achieve the high throughput, so you have to trade a lot in terms of
flexibility to get high distributed throughput. If you are new to the
area of MQ and brokers, I guess Kafka is overkill. On the other hand -
if you have a decent sized server cluster and wonder how to push as
many messages as possible through it - give Kafka a spin!

## Kafka ui?

  kafka-ui:
    container_name: kafka-ui
    image: provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:29093
    environment:
      DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED: 'true'
    volumes:
      - ~/kui/config.yml:/etc/kafkaui/dynamic_config.yaml
